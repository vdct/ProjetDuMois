### Osmium building

ProjetDuMois requires a recent version of osmium as it takes advantage to newest tags-filter abilities.
Not many Linux distros got the appropriate package available in their repositories and you may need to build your own binary of osmium.

See guidelines on the [official README](https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool/blob/master/README.md#building).

Following packets on debian can be useful

- build-essential
- cmake
- zlib1g-dev
- libbz2-dev
- liblz4-dev
- libboost-dev
- libboost-program-options-dev

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vdct/ProjetDuMois.git
cd ProjetDuMois
git submodule update --init
```

## General configuration

The general configuration of the tool is to be filled in `config.json`. There is a suggested model in the `config.example.json` file. The parameters are as follows:

- `OSM_USER`: OpenStreetMap username for retrieving the modification history with metadata
- `OSM_PASS`: password associated with the OSM user account
- `OSM_CLIENT_ID` : client ID généré depuis le compte OpenStreetMap
- `OSH_PBF_URL`: URL of the OSH.PBF file (history and metadata, example `https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/europe/france/reunion-internal.osh.pbf`)
- `DB_USE_IMPOSM_UPDATE` : enable or disabled Imposm3 integration (to use an existing database which would be maintained by other means, by default `true`)
- `WORK_DIR`: download and temporary storage folder (must have capacity to store the OSH PBF file, example `/tmp/pdm`)
- `OSM_URL`: OpenStreetMap instance to use (example `https://www.openstreetmap.org`)
- `OSM_API_URL` : API OpenStreetMap instance to use (example `https://www.api.openstreetmap.org`)

- `MATOMO_SITE`: ID of the Matomo website you want to report analytics (example `6`)
- `REPOSITORY_URL`: URL of the software repository (example `https://github.com/vdct/ProjetDuMois`)
- `VECT_STYLE` : URL to [Maplibre GL compatible style](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) (example `https://tile-vect.openstreetmap.fr/styles/liberty/style.json`)
- `PDM_TILES_URL`: URL to access the _pg_tileserv_ service, which provides the layers in your database
- `GEOJSON_BOUNDS`: object of `Geometry` type (polygon or multipolygon) in GeoJSON delimiting the area to search for OSM notes.
- `MAINTENANCE_MODE`: optional flag to display a notice page on website when doing maintenance (set to `true` to enable)

### Postgresql connection

As to connect to any Postgresql host, `DB_URL` environement variable is expected to be set with a conninfo string.
This is necessary for standalone or Docker environments.

```bash
export DB_URL="postgres://user:password@host:5432/database"
```

See also 33.1.1 chapter about [Postgresql conninfo strings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html).

## Project configuration

Each project is defined via a subdirectory of `projects'. Each subdirectory must contain the following files :

- `info.json` : project metadata
- `howto.md`: description of tasks to be performed in Markdown format (use title levels >= 3)
- `contribs.sql` : SQL script containing UPDATE request on `pdm_changes` table, to set contribution classes to certain type of OSM changes and associate points

The properties in `info.json` are as follows:

- `id`: mission identifier (authorized characters: A-Z, 0-9, \_ and -)
- `title`: name of the mission (short enough)
- `start_date`: start date of the mission (format YYYYY-MM-DD)
- `end_date`: end date of the mission (format YYYYY-MM-DD)
- `summary`: summary of the mission
- `links`: definition of the URLs for links to third party pages (OSM wiki)
- `database.osmium_tag_filter` : Osmium filter on the tags to be applied to keep only the relevant OSM objects (for example `nwr/*:covid19`, [syntax described here](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/manual.html#filtering-by-tags)). It is possible to list many filters using `&` character and same syntax. Only latest defined filter will be used for Osmium feature counts.
- `database.imposm`: configuration for importing updated OSM data (`types` for geometry types to be taken into account, `mapping` for attributes, see [the Imposm documentation](https://imposm.org/docs/imposm3/latest/mapping.html#tags) for the format of these fields)
- `database.compare`: configuration for the search of OpenStreetMap objects to compare, follows the format of `database.imposm` with an additional property `radius` (reconciliation radius in meters)
- `datasources`: list of data sources that appear on the page (see below)
- `statistics`: configuration of statistics display on the project page
- `statistics.count`: enable object counting in OSM
- `statistics.feature_name`: name to display to the user for these objects
- `statistics.osmose_tasks`: name of the tasks performed via Osmose
- `statistics.points`: configuration of the points obtained according to the type of contribution (in relation with `contribs.sql`)
- `editors`: specific configuration to each OSM editor. ProjetDuMois is described below, for iD, it is possible to use [the parameters listed here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/develop/API.md).

### Projects timing

It is possible to define projects occuring during overlapping time periods. The `project:update` script will only update currently active projects.

### Disable imposm3 usage

It is possible to not use Imposm3 and connect to an existing database already populated with necessary data.
You should make sure that it is correctly hourly-updated for this application needs.

In case Imposm3 is disabled, you have also to make available materialized views named `pdm_project_${project_id}`, with following structure:

```sql
osm_id BIGINT
name VARCHAR(255)
tags json
geom GEOMETRY
```

Optionally, if compare mode is enabled in a given project, another view `pdm_project_${project_id}_compare` containing data to which features should be compared is necessary. It has the same structure as described above.

In complement of these tables, you need a `pdm_boundary` table with administrative boundaries for your area ([administrative levels](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative) 4, 6 and 8) with following structure:

```sql
id INT
osm_id BIGINT
name VARCHAR
admin_level INT
tags HSTORE
geom GEOMETRY(Geometry, 3857)
centre GEOMETRY(Point, 3857)
```

`centre` column is understood as a point included in the boundary shape (you can use [ST_PointOnSurface](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_PointOnSurface.html))

Create indexes on `osm_id`, `tags`, `geom` and `centre` columns might be useful depending of your database content.

PdM will autonomously derivate a `pdm_boundary_subdivide` table with usage of [ST_Subdivide](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Subdivide.html) function as to improve features intersection with admin boundaries.

### Data sources

Several data sources can be used, and are to be displayed in the `datasources` field of the `info.json` file.

#### Osmose

[Osmose](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose) is a tool for quality analysis and open data integration. The properties to be filled in are the following:

- `source` (mandatory `osmose`): source type
- `item`: item number (four-digit code)
- `class` (optional): class number (multi-digit code)
- `country` (optional): Osmose country name pattern (example `france*`)
- `name`: name to be displayed to the user
- `subtitles` (optional): key object > value to replace the subtitles of Osmose reports (search by pattern)
- `buttons`: label to be displayed on the edit buttons (example `{ "done": "It's done", "false": "Nothing here" }`)
- `minzoom` (default 7): minimum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `maxzoom` (default 18): maximum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `tiles` (default): TMS URL list

#### OSM Notes

The [OpenStreetMap notes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes) are a simple method for sending text comments on the map, and facilitate contribution by novice audiences. The properties to be filled in are the following:

- `source` (mandatory `notes`): source type
- `name`: name to be displayed to the user
- `description`: descriptive text explaining the resolution method for a note
- `terms`: list of terms to search for in the notes (singular)
- `buttons`: label to display on the edit buttons (example `{ "close": "It's done" }`)
- `data` (default): data in Geojson format

#### OpenStreetMap objects

Objects currently present in OpenStreetMap can be displayed to avoid duplicates and allow editing. The properties to be filled in are the following:

- `source` (mandatory `osm`): source type
- `name`: name to be displayed to the user
- `description`: descriptive text of the displayed object
- `minzoom` (default 7): minimum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `maxzoom` (default 14): maximum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `tiles` (default): TMS URL list
- `layers` (default): Layer names list to use and corresponding to `tiles` indices

This source can appear only once, and corresponds to the objects searched for in the `database` options of `info.json`.

#### OpenStreetMap objects for comparison

Objects indirectly related to the project but relevant to the contribution may also appear. The properties to be filled in are the following:

- `source` (mandatory `osm-compare`): type of source
- `name`: name to be displayed to the user

- `maxzoom` (default 14): maximum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `tiles` (default): TMS URL list
- `layers` (default): Layer names list to use and corresponding to `tiles` indices

This source can only appear once, and corresponds to the objects searched for in the `database.compare` options of `info.json`.

#### OpenStreetMap extra objects

Objects outside the project's scope, displayed as to inform contributors that something different already exists in place. The properties to be filled in are the following:

- `source` (mandatory `osm-extra`): type of source
- `name`: name to be displayed to the user
- `description`: descriptive text of the displayed object

This source can appear as many time as required

#### Background imagery

Raster tile imagery can be added in background to make contribution easier or give context. You have to define following properties:

- `source` (mandatory `background`): type of source
- `icon` (default `other`): symbol to display in legend (between `aerial`, `thematic`, `picture`, `other`)

These sources should be declared in reverse order of display. The lower layer should be declared first.

#### Sources stats

Another kind of datasource can be added and refers to geographical statistics, over administrative boundaries for instance

- `source` (mandatory `stats`): statistics source type
- `minzoom` (default 2): minimum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `maxzoom` (default 14): maximum zoom level for making this layer visible
- `tiles` (default): list of TMS URL
- `layers` (default): Layer names list to use and corresponding to `tiles` indices

### Projet du Mois integrated editor

Project configuration allows to customize embedded editor with appropriate fields. Let's consider following json to be set in the `editors` list:

```json
"pdm": {
  "fields": [
    ... fields list...
  ],
  "title": {
    "add": "Add action label",
    "edit": "Edit action label"
  }
}
```

Fields are defined with standard JSON objects added to the `fields` array in the uspide json.
Every type except `hidden` supports those common attributes:

- `name`: Field name to be displayed to the user
- `help`: HREF link to a relevant help page regarding this particular field
- `description`: An extensive text displayed to the user providing details about the field
- `optional`: A boolean false/true field making the field respectively mandatory or not

#### Static or external attributes

Define static tags to be added to every created object by the editor, or retrieve existing values from external sources (like identifiers from Osmose such as `ref:FR:SIRET` tag, use in that case `*` value).

```json
{ "type": "hidden", "tags": { "tag_1": "value_1", "tag_2": "value_2", "external_tag_3": "*" } }
```

#### Scalar field

Text fields comes with 3 different types: text, number or email.
They're all producing a standard text field, leading to a given OSM key with appropriate validation features.

```json
  { "type": "text", "name": "Field label", "tag": "tag_key", "optional": false },
  { "type": "number", "name": "Field label", "tag": "tag_key", "optional": false },
  { "type": "email", "name": "Field label", "tag": "tag_key", "optional": false }
```

#### Textarea field

A wider textarea field similar to text one.

```json
{ "type": "textarea", "name": "Field label", "tag": "tag_key", "optional": false }
```

#### Drop down list

A drop down list with custom entries leading to a given OSM tag

```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "name": "Field label",
  "tag": "tag_key",
  "optional": false,
  "values": [
    { "v": "value_1", "l": "Value 1 label" },
    { "v": "value_2", "l": "Value 2 label" }
  ]
}
```

You can also set multiple tags using a single value in the list, for example:

```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "name": "Type",
  "tag": "_select1",
  "values": [
    {
      "l": "National police",
      "tags": { "name": "National police", "operator": "National police", "police:FR": "police" }
    },
    { "l": "City police", "tags": { "name": "City police", "police:FR": "police_municipale" } }
  ]
}
```

In case of multiple tags for a single value, you can force removal of certain tags with empty strings, for example to cover objects that belongs to different categories:

```json
{
  "type": "select",
  "name": "Type de commerce",
  "tag": "_select1",
  "values": [
    { "l": "Agence d'assurance", "tags": { "shop": "", "office": "insurance" } },
    { "l": "Agence de voyages", "tags": { "shop": "travel_agency", "office": "" } }
  ]
}
```

#### 2 or 3 states

States input are using radio buttons to provide 2 or 3 options to the user. It leads to a given OSM key.
`2states` is yes/unknown and `3states` is yes/no/unknown.

```json
  { "type": "2states", "name": "Field label", "tag": "tag_key"},
  { "type": "3states", "name": "Field label", "tag": "tag_key"}
```

#### Brands and operators

To make brand or operators input easier, you can use the `nsi` field (related to [Name Suggestion Index](https://nsi.guide/), a collaborative listing of all brands and operators worldwide). It has specific options:

- `path` : path to brand listing to use (this appears in website title, for example `brands/shop/coffee`)
- `locationSet` : a two-letter, lowercase country code to only list brands from this specific country (optional)

For example:

```json
{ "type": "nsi", "name": "Brand", "path": "brands/shop/bakery", "locationSet": "fr" }
```

#### Icons group

Icon select fields allow simple selecting of several similar attributes, for example available sockets at a charging station or kind of waste accepted in a recycling container. Icons must be available in the `/website/images/form` folder, as PNG image. Tags associated to an icon are applied on feature if icon is selected.

```json
{
  "type": "icons",
  "name": "Available sockets",
  "tag": "_socket",
  "values": [
    { "icon": "socket_typee", "label": "TE", "tags": { "socket:typee": "yes" } },
    { "icon": "socket_type2", "label": "T2", "tags": { "socket:type2": "yes" } },
    { "icon": "socket_type2_combo", "label": "T2 Combo", "tags": { "socket:type2_combo": "yes" } },
    { "icon": "socket_chademo", "label": "Chademo", "tags": { "socket:chademo": "yes" } }
  ]
}
```

### Feature counts and statistics

Project statistics are made by `./db/31_projects_update_tmp.sh` script. This script fills `pdm_feature_counts` SQL table with missing daily data according to last OSH file timestamp and current day.

It is possible to force full recount for a project by deleting OSH timestamp file, retreive again PBF/PBH files and launch again the script:

```bash
rm ${WORK_DIR}/osh_timestamp
./db/11_pbf_update_tmp.sh
./db/31_projects_update_tmp.sh
```

#### Points and contributions

Certain OSM contributions can give points to users.
Each project configuration set how many points are given according to the type of contribution.
By default, the platform create the following contribution types:

- `add`: changes concerning features with version=1 (creation)
- `edit` : changes concerning features version>1 (tag or geometry edits)

It is possible to attribute your own type for each project by creating a `contribs.sql` file next to `info.json`.
This script contains UPDATE SQL requests to add entries in `pdm_changes` table. Each OSM change can only have a single type and have a single amount of points associated.

Configuration of points is in `info.json`:

```json
{
  "statistics": {
    "points": { "add": 3, "project1": 1 }
  }
}
```

## Build

Once PDM has been properly configured, you should choose between Docker or standalone to build it.
Refers to Database section in run chapter to make ProjetDuMois fully runable.

### git submodules

ProjetDuMois relies on some git submodules. Please mind using the following to retreive them prior to build

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Docker build

You can build a node.js based ProjetDuMois server including necessary features to run. It includes osmium 1.10.0 with Debian Buster.
It doesn't includes a PgSQL server. You can use [CampToCamp Postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/r/camptocamp/postgres/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).

```bash
docker build [--build-arg IMPOSM3_VERSION=0.11.0] -t pdm/server:latest .
```

Where:

- IMPOSM3_VERSION: Version of imposm3 to use in the docker image

### Standalone instance

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

### Database

The database relies on PostgreSQL. To create the database :

```bash
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE pdm"
```

### pg_tileserv

#### Without Docker

As pg_tileserv is required to display osm data on the map, you'll have to install it or use the image include in docker-compose file.
You will need `wget` and `unzip` to use it.

```bash
# download latest build
wget https://postgisftw.s3.amazonaws.com/pg_tileserv_latest_linux.zip
# unzip / delete it
unzip pg_tileserv_latest_linux.zip -d /opt/pg_tileserv
rm pg_tileserv_latest_linux.zip
# specify database url to connect
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@pdm-db:5432/pdm
# launch it
cd /opt/pg_tileserv
./pg_tileserv
```

#### Using Docker

You can use the image in docker-compose.yml or for a lightweight image you should build yourself the [alpine Dockerfile](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv/blob/master/Dockerfile.alpine)
It's possible to install pg_tileserv in pdm Dockerfile before building the image. But it's not recommended.

### Docker

Database is installed and inited simply with:

```bash
docker run --rm [--network=your-network] -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest install
docker run --rm [--network=your-network] -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest init
```

And then run the server with:

```bash
docker run -d --rm [--network=your-network] -p 3000:3000 --name=pdm -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest run
```

Don't forger to add following lines into your crontab for periodic updates, for example daily updates:

```bash
docker run --rm [--network=your-network] -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest update_daily
```

Individual updates are also available for punctual calls:

```bash
docker run --rm [--network=your-network] -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest update_pbf
docker run --rm [--network=your-network] -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest update_features
docker run --rm [--network=your-network] -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest update_projects
```

### Standalone

Database relies on PostgreSQL. To install the schema before first run:

```bash
psql -d pdm -f db/00_init.sql
```

The following script is to run to retreive and update PBF/PBH files:

```bash
npm run pbf:update
./db/11_pbf_update_tmp.sh
```

The following script is to run after first initialization of database to create list of OSM features:

```bash
npm run features:update
./db/21_features_update_tmp.sh init
```

The following script has to be launched daily to retrieve the contribution statistics (notes, objects added, badges obtained):

```bash
npm run projects:update
./db/31_projects_update_tmp.sh
```

## Website

The code for the web interface can be found in the `website` folder. This is an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) server, combined with [Pug](https://pugjs.org) templates.

The Pug templates are in the `templates` sub-folder. It is organized according to the following logic:

- In `templates`, the general model `layout.pug` and its CSS file
- In `common`, generic elements to all pages (`<head>`, header, footer)
- In `components`, the main components that populate the pages (map, statistics block...)
- In `pages`, each page of the site (home, map, project page...)

The site can be viewed at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Docker

Docker image includes websites and background updating tasks.
You can run it with:

```bash
docker run -d --rm [--network=your-network] -p 3000:3000 --name=pdm -v host_work_dir:container_work_dir -e DB_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database pdm/server:latest run
```

### Docker compose

A compose file is provided to ease the running processing. It won't prevent you from creating database, adding users and make the appropriate configuration nor building dockers as mentionned upside.
Docker compose only allows to run easilly a functionnal instance if and only it has already been properly configured before.

Depending on your Postgresql configuration, you'll surely have to customize the `DB_URL` env variable in the compose file to let the pdm server access the database safely.

Don't try to run the instance with docker-compose first, try to run each component separately and check if everything work as expected.
Once everything runs normally, you can use the following for further runs:

To start:

```
docker-compose up
```

To stop:

```
docker-compose down
```

### Standalone

Standalone running requires a node server complient with compatility at the top of this document and planned tasks to update projects regularly.

To launch the web site :

```bash
export DB_URL="postgres://user:password@host:5432/database" # Database URL
export PORT=3000 # Nodejs port (defaults to 3000)
npm run start
```

The site can be viewed at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
