# Podoma

_The OpenStreetMap statistics engine for thematic contributions !_

## About

Podoma is a powerful, full-featured, engine and dashboard for getting precise statistics about OpenStreetMap community contributions over specific topics. Its main features are:

- Create thematic projects to follow
- Generate daily and/or historical statistics
- Follow precisely features, notes, contributors over time
- Highly configurable to meet all your needs

## Help improve this tool

The tool is free (as in free beer and as much as in free speech) and developed by a team of volunteers. You can help improve this project by:
* [Giving return on experience and constructive suggestions](https://gitlab.com/PanierAvide/Podoma/-/issues) in French or in English
* [Submitting software code](DEVELOP.md) for new features or bug fixes

This project embraces the [digital principles for development](https://digitalprinciples.org/).
